By inputting various data points, such as the purchase price, down payment, interest rate, loan term, rental income, and other monthly expenses and submitting a property via a POST request to /properties, the back end calculates various investment property analysis metrics and returns them to the front end. These include

-mortgage payment
-total monthly expenses
-monthly cash flow
-cash on cash return
